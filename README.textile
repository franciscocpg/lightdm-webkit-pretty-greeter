h1. Installation

h2. Prerequisites

Pretty greeter is built on top of lightdm-webkit-greeter. So it has to be installed.

For Ubuntu users, if you haven't already installed it, open a terminal and type:

bc. 
bash <(curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/franciscocpg/f924ec29393c5247ee0b/raw/)

h2. Pretty greeter installation

# Download "pretty greeter":https://github.com/jfbrazeau/lightdm-webkit-pretty-greeter/zipball/master
# Unzip it in @https://github.com/jfbrazeau/lightdm-webkit-pretty-greeter/tarball/master@
# This should create a folder named like @jfbrazeau-lightdm-webkit-pretty-greeter-28c4b13@
# Rename this folder to @pretty@ (so that the complete path becomes @/usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/pretty@)
# Edit the resource @/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf@ and set @webkit-theme@ property to @pretty@ :

bc. 
bash <(curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/franciscocpg/b42d0566366f5ce1a39f/raw/)

Now if you restart your computer (or at least if you restart lightdm), the pretty greeter should be activated. 

h1. Uninstallation

To uninstall pretty greeter, simply restore the @greeter-session@ property of the @/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf@ file and restart your computer (or at least lightdm).

You may also want to :
# Remove the folder @pretty@ created in @/usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/@
# Restore the @webkit-theme@ property of the @/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf@ file

h1. User icons management

To change users icons, there are two options :

* Create a @.face@ file in the user's home folder in which you put a @jpg@ or @png@ resource

Or 

* Create a resource named with the user's login in @/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/@
* Edit @/var/lib/AccountsService/users/<userLogin>@ and add a property @Icon@ targeting the icon resource you just created

Pretty greeter works well with 96x96 images.
